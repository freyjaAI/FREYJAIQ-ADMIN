Below is the cheapest, fastest, and most effective way to build a system that beats LexisNexis specifically for commercial real-estate brokerages and financial brokerages whose only goals are:



✔️ Input: 
Name, Social, EIN, Address, or Company Name


✔️ Output: 
Phone numbers, emails, property ownership, LLC ties, and contact information


✔️ Purpose: 
Prospecting, outreach, underwriting, portfolio analysis


This focuses ONLY on what CRE firms actually need — NOT the full LexisNexis platform.

🔥 
PART 1 — Exact Feature Set You Need (Lean Version That Beats LexisNexis)


To beat LexisNexis for CRE brokers, you only need two categories:



1️⃣ 
Identity Resolution / Contact Information


→ Get direct phones & emails for individuals or LLCs.



2️⃣ 
Property Ownership & LLC Unmasking


→ Link the person/LLC to the real properties they own.



That’s it.

LexisNexis has tons of extra products CRE brokers never use.

🔥 PART 2 — 
Cheapest & Best Data Sources to Beat LexisNexis


Here is the minimum, lowest-cost data stack that still outperforms LexisNexis for CRE prospecting.

✅ 
1. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP + APN DATA (Cheapest Reliable Source)


The cheapest reliable nationwide property dataset:



Estated API


Cost: $99–$499/mo

Data:

Owner name

Mailing address

Property address

Sale history

Assessed value

Basic building facts

APN



You can enrich it later with ATTOM or CoreLogic, but Estated gives 70–80% of what brokers need.



Upgrade Option (More Expensive but very strong):


DataTree (First American) → $2k–$8k/mo

ATTOM → $3k–$15k/mo



But for the cheapest & best, Estated wins.

✅ 
2. BUSINESS / LLC OWNER INFO


You need to unmask who actually owns an LLC.



Cheapest + best sources:



OpenCorporates API
 — $99/mo


Pulls:

Officers

Registered agents

Addresses

Filings



Secretary of State Bulk Files
 — Many states = free


You can download:

LLC managers

Members

Registered agent

Company address



This replaces Lexis Corporate Filings.

✅ 
3. CONTACT INFORMATION (Phones + Emails)


This is where LexisNexis is strongest—so you beat them by using cheaper, modern sources.



BEST CHEAP COMBO:


IDICIA “identity + phone” API
 → $0.004–$0.01 per lookup
Fresh phone & name matches

Checks telecom carrier

Validates line type

Very accurate



TowerData for Emails
 → $0.005–$0.01 per lookup
Email discovery

Email validation

Household & business enrichment



Clearbit (business contacts)
 → Freemium + cheap scale plans


This finds:

Company emails

Direct dials

Employee profiles



👉 This trio gives MORE phone/email accuracy than LexisNexis at 1/10th the cost.

✅ 
4. ADDRESS & IDENTITY MATCHING


Cheap and extremely powerful:



Melissa Data
 → $100–$500/mo


Gives:

Name/Address matching

Phone matches

Resident/occupancy

Move history



Pairs perfectly with your enrichment stack.

TOTAL COST:


If you choose the minimum viable Lexis-killer stack:

Estated: $99–$499/mo

OpenCorporates: $99/mo

Melissa: $100/mo

IDICIA pay-per-use: ~$100/mo

TowerData pay-per-use: ~$50–$100/mo



Estimated Monthly Cost: $350–$900/mo


→ FULL system equivalent to Lexis but built specifically for CRE prospecting

→ Lexis typically costs $1,200–$3,000/mo per seat



You beat their pricing AND beat their data accuracy in 2 categories.

🔥 PART 3 — How You Beat LexisNexis (Functionally)


Here’s exactly how you outperform them in ways CRE firms will LOVE:

1️⃣ 
AI-Layer That Unmasks LLCs Automatically


Your software automatically connects:

LLC name

Corporate officers

Property ownership records

Mailing address matches

Phone/email lookups

Relative/co-owner associations



Lexis makes brokers do this manually.

Your system makes it 1 click.

2️⃣ 
AI-Verified Contact Confidence Score


You generate:



“This phone number is 92% likely to be the correct owner.”


Lexis doesn’t provide confidence scoring.

Brokers waste time calling dead numbers — your system eliminates that.

3️⃣ 
One-Click “Owner Dossier” PDF


Contains:

All phones

All emails

All properties owned

LLCs tied to client

EIN → company linkage

Addresses

Portfolio valuation

AI-recommended outreach script



CRE brokers LOVE fast dossiers.

Lexis reports are outdated and ugly.
