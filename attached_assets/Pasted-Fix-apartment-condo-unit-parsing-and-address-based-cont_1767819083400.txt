Fix apartment/condo unit parsing and address-based contact enrichment:

PROBLEM: Searching "690 SW 1ST CT apt ph004" found correct owner (Bruce Turner Mitchell) but enrichment pulled WRONG person's data - someone from Jacksonville FL with 904 area codes instead of the Miami apartment owner.

ROOT CAUSE: Enrichment searches by NAME ONLY without verifying the person actually lives at the property address.

CRITICAL FIXES:

1. ADDRESS NORMALIZATION - Add apartment unit parsing:
- Parse apt/unit/ph/ste numbers from search input
- Normalize formats: "apt ph004", "#PH004", "Unit PH-004" → "APT PH004"
- Store property_unit field in properties table
- Store both full address (with unit) and base address

2. CONTACT ENRICHMENT WITH ADDRESS VALIDATION:
- ALWAYS pass property address context to enrichment providers
- Filter enrichment results to ONLY persons with matching city/state
- REJECT results if person's address is in different city (e.g., reject Jacksonville when property is Miami)
- Add addressMatchScore field (0-100): 100=exact match, 50=same city, 0=different city (reject)

3. ENRICHMENT SERVICE CHANGES (server/dossierService.ts):
```javascript
async enrichOwnerContacts(owner, property) {
  const addressContext = {
    street: property.address,
    city: property.city,
    state: property.state,
    propertyUnit: property.property_unit
  };
  
  // Pass address to enrichment
  const data = await enrichWithAddress(owner.name, addressContext);
  
  // VALIDATE before storing
  if (data.city !== property.city) {
    console.warn(`REJECT: ${data.city} ≠ ${property.city}`);
    return null; // Don't store wrong person
  }
}
```

4. PROVIDER UPDATES:
- AttomProvider: Add address filter to person lookup
- DataAxleProvider: Include property city in search criteria  
- ApifySkipTraceProvider: Pass property address, filter by location

5. DATABASE:
- Add properties.property_unit column
- Add owners.enrichment_address_match_score column
- Add owners.enrichment_status: 'not_enriched' | 'enriched' | 'address_mismatch'

6. UI WARNING:
- If enrichment address doesn't match property, show: "⚠️ Contact info may be for different person"
- Add "Re-Enrich" button to retry with stricter matching

CRITICAL: Never show contact info if addresses don't match. Better NO data than WRONG data.
