I need to implement critical fixes to the LLC ownership chain resolution logic. Based on my analysis, the current system has several gaps:

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. No parent company discovery - system doesn't query OpenCorporates for parent/holding companies
2. Limited entity detection - only keyword-based, misses entities without LLC/INC suffix
3. Chain resolution stops at first person found - doesn't verify if they're the true beneficial owner
4. No recursive parent entity lookup

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

**Phase 1: Enhance llcChainResolver.ts**
1. Add parent company field extraction after getting LLC data from OpenCorporates
2. When an officer is identified as an entity, recursively query for THEIR parent company
3. Continue traversing until finding individuals (Ultimate Beneficial Owners)

**Phase 2: Improve dataProviders.ts - fetchLlcUnmasking function**
1. After getting company data, explicitly query for parent companies/corporate network
2. Add logic to search across ALL jurisdictions to find the "home state" filing (has real officers) vs "foreign state" filings (only agents)
3. When officers are found to be entities, recursively resolve them

**Phase 3: Better entity detection**
1. Instead of just keyword matching, verify entities by actually querying OpenCorporates
2. Check if officer name appears in OpenCorporates database as a registered company
3. Extract parent_company and controlled_by relationships

**KEY CODE CHANGES NEEDED:**

In llcChainResolver.ts after getting llcData:
```typescript
// Check for parent company
if (llc.parent_company) {
  console.log(`Found parent company: ${llc.parent_company}`);
  await traverse(llc.parent_company, depth + 1, "parent_company");
}

// For each officer that's an entity, check for THEIR parent
for (const officer of officers) {
  if (isEntityName(officer.name)) {
    // Query OpenCorporates to see if THIS entity has a parent
    const officerLlcData = await getCachedLlcData(officer.name, jurisdiction);
    if (officerLlcData?.llc?.parent_company) {
      await traverse(officerLlcData.llc.parent_company, depth + 1, "parent_of_officer");
    }
  }
}
```

In dataProviders.ts fetchLlcUnmasking:
```typescript
// After getting fullCompany, check for parent companies
if (fullCompany.parent_company || fullCompany.controlled_by) {
  console.log(`Entity has parent: ${fullCompany.parent_company || fullCompany.controlled_by}`);
  // Store parent company info in the result
}

// When officers are entities, note them for recursive resolution
const entityOfficers = officers.filter(o => isEntityName(o.name));
if (entityOfficers.length > 0) {
  console.log(`Found ${entityOfficers.length} entity officers that need recursive resolution`);
}
```

Can you implement these changes? The goal is to properly traverse corporate structures to find the ACTUAL beneficial owners, not just stop at the first entity or person we find.
