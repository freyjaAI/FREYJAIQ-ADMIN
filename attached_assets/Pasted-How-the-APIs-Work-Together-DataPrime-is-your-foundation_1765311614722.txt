How the APIs Work Together
DataPrime is your foundation - it takes name + address and returns verified/corrected addresses, NCOA (moved) information, multiple historical addresses, and identity verification. It tells you if the person actually lives where you think they do.
Forward Phone Append (FPA) finds phone numbers from name + address. It can return multiple results and includes match scoring so you know how confident the match is.
Email Append (EMA) finds email addresses from name + address, with Individual or Household match types and validation status.
Email Validation (EMV) validates any email you already have or get from EMA - tells you deliverability, domain type, and can correct typos.
Optimal Workflow for Maximum Accuracy
Step 1: Verify/Correct the Address with DataPrime
GET https://dev-api.idicia.com/Services/NameAddress/DataPrime/1_1/dataprime.svc/{lastName}
    ?firstName={firstName}
    &address1={address}
    &city={city}
    &state={state}
    &accountKey={key}

Header: X-PacificEast-Acct: {your_account_key}
This gives you:

addressAction: 0=good, 2=person moved (NCOA), check the response
verifiedIdentity: true means name is confirmed at this address
addresses[]: current + historical addresses with isMostRecent flag
knownDeceased: important filter

Step 2: Get Phone Numbers with FPA
Use the verified/corrected address from DataPrime:
GET https://dev-api.idicia.com/Services/Forward/Append/1_1/Append.svc/{queryType}
    ?firstName={firstName}
    &lastName={lastName}
    &address={address}
    &city={city}
    &state={state}
    &postalCode={zip}

Header: X-PacificEast-Acct: {your_account_key}
Query types: 0=standard, 1=prioritize landline, 2=prioritize wireless
The matchInfo array is critical - look for overallName and overallAddress scores of 8-10 (high/exact match).
Step 3: Get Email with EMA
GET https://dev-api.idicia.com/Services/Email/Append/1_3/Append.svc/{queryType}
    ?lastName={lastName}
    &firstName={firstName}
    &address={address}
    &city={city}
    &state={state}
    &purpose=FR

Header: X-PacificEast-Acct: {your_account_key}
Query types: Individual (stricter) or Household
Check validationStatus: "Validated" > "Unknown" > "Not validated"
Step 4: Validate the Email with EMV
GET https://dev-api.idicia.com/Services/Email/Validation/1_1/emailvalidation.svc/{email}
    ?purpose=FR

Header: X-PacificEast-Acct: {your_account_key}
Key fields:

deliverability: 50=Deliverable, 40=Valid, 30=Risky, 20=Undeliverable
validationStatus: 1=Valid, 70=Mailbox invalid
correctionCode: 1 means it auto-corrected a typo

Query Tuning Strategy (from FPA docs)
If initial queries fail, progressively loosen:

Remove first name (household match)
Remove unit/apt number
Remove city/state, keep ZIP
Remove ZIP, keep city/state
Remove address entirely (name + location only)

Stop when you get a high-confidence match (score 8+).
